## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Heart Disease Prediction** dataset (derived from the UCI Cleveland dataset). The goal is to identify key risk factors associated with heart disease and visualize patterns distinguishing healthy patients from those with the disease.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of **270 observations** and **14 variables**.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | Age in years |
| **Sex** | 1 = Male, 0 = Female |
| **Chest pain type** | 1: Typical angina, 2: Atypical angina, 3: Non-anginal, 4: Asymptomatic |
| **BP** | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| **Cholesterol** | Serum cholesterol in mg/dl |
| **FBS over 120** | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False) |
| **EKG results** | 0: Normal, 1: ST-T wave abnormality, 2: LV hypertrophy |
| **Max HR** | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| **Exercise angina** | Exercise induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| **ST depression** | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
| **Slope of ST** | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1: Up, 2: Flat, 3: Down) |
| **Number of vessels fluro** | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy |
| **Thallium** | 3 = Normal; 6 = Fixed defect; 7 = Reversable defect |
| **Heart Disease** | Target variable (Presence vs Absence) |
